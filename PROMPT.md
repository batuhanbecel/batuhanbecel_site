Profession: Retoucher
Experience start: 2013

Use the following About Me text as the authoritative source for biography, timeline, and experience content. Do not rewrite unless explicitly requested.

I began my professional journey in 2013 as a Photographer’s Assistant at f/2.8 Production Agency. This period marked a unique starting point, allowing me to gain hands-on industry experience while developing a deep understanding of the creative production process.

Between 2014 and 2018, I actively worked in the field of visual communication and design at Istanbul Burhan Felek Anatolian High School. During this time, I strengthened my expertise by contributing to a wide range of projects, from printed materials such as posters, panels, and roll-ups to video editing and post-production work.

During my university years, my passion for design evolved into a more multidimensional practice. While studying at Marmara University, I joined the Faculty of Communication’s prestigious Communication Club. From 2019 to 2021, I served as Design Committee Leader and as a Member of the Executive Board, where I gained substantial experience in team leadership and organizing creative processes. This period became a turning point in understanding the critical role of collaboration and leadership within creative work.

After graduating, I continued my career in May 2021 as a Creative Designer at Walther Kranz Agency. There, I developed social media content designs for prestigious brands such as MediaCat, Rolls-Royce Istanbul, and A1 Capital. Through projects that strengthened brand identities and fostered meaningful connections with target audiences, I consistently pushed the boundaries of design. This experience played a key role in refining my creative vision and adapting to the discipline of working with global brands.

As of November 2022, my career journey reached another meaningful milestone when I returned to f/2.8 Production Agency, this time as a Retoucher. Producing creative visuals and bringing 3D projects to life continues to contribute significantly to both my professional growth and the expansion of my creative portfolio.
